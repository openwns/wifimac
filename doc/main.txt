 *
 * The WiFiMAC provides an IEEE 802.11-conformant Data Link Layer,
 * including the following features:
 * @li IEEE 802.11 Distributed Contention Function medium access with
 *     virtual and physical carrier sense.
 * @li RTS/CTS frame exchange to reduce the hidden node problem
 * @li IEEE 802.11-2007 Transmission Opportunities
 * @li IEEE 802.11 Draft N MPDU aggregation
 * @li IEEE 802.11 Draft N Block Acknowledgement
 * @li IEEE 802.11 Draft N MIMO-based Modulation and Coding Schemes using
 *     a simple post-SINR based MIMO transmission model
 * @li Opportunistic rate adaptation with closed and open loop control
 * @li Mesh networking with path selection using mesh points as intermediate hops
